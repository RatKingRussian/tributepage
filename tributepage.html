He has conanoically defeated Melania who, in a desperate bid to not be seen as a little bitch, nuked the whole of Caelid with Scarlet Rot making it an empty wasteland and still being unable to kill the warrior. </li>
            <li name="list-facts">In the early stages of the game of Elden Ring Radahn was such an intensely difficult fight FromSoftware was forced to nerf his hitboxes and damage in patch 1.03. (although the damage was later reinstated in a later patch)</li>

            <li name="list-facts">Radahn is the only Shardbearer in the game with no intro dialogue (this is seen as sensible as he has lost his mind.)</li>
